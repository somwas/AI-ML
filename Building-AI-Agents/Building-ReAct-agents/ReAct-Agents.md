# ReAct Agents

## Core Concept: The ReAct Loop

**ReAct = Reasoning + Acting**

Think of it as giving AI a "brain" (reasoning) AND "hands" (ability to take actions).

### The Pattern

```
Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → Action → Observation...
```

## Key components to understand

### 1. Reasoning (The "Thinking" Part)

- AI breaks down complex problems into steps
- Plans what to do next
- Analyzes results from previous actions
- Decides when it has enough information

### 2. Acting (The "Doing" Part)

- Using tools: web search, calculators, databases
- Making API calls
- Running code
- Accessing external systems

### 3. Observation (The "Learning" Part)

- Processing results from actions
- Understanding what worked/didn't work
- Using new information for next reasoning step

## How It Actually Works

### Traditional AI

```
Question → AI thinks → Answer
```

### ReAct Agent

```
Question → 
  Think: "What do I need to know?" → 
  Act: Search web → 
  Observe: "Found some info" → 
  Think: "Need more specific data" → 
  Act: Use calculator → 
  Observe: "Got the numbers" → 
  Think: "Now I can answer" → 
  Final Answer
